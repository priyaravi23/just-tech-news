## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) - Just Tech News

### Description 

*Just Tech News—a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Use Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify your MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connect your application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku*

### Mock-Up

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

### Description

*Create the front end for Just Tech News using Handlebars.js, a popular templating engine. The application’s codebase will also be structured to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, to ensure a separation of concerns. Finally, to provide authentication, build on the password hashing from the application’s back end so that logged-in users can update and delete their posts through a special dashboard interface.*
